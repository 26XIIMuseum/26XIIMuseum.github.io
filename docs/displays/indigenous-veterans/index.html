        <p>This Indigenous display is relatively new to the Museum. To your left is a large oil painting by Indigenous artist Jessie Janusca depicting the role of the Indigenous peoples in the Canadian military over the years. Notice the sacred eagle soaring in the skies over the open grasslands and bison. The Indigenous mother sending her son off to fight in World War I symbolizes the sacrifice of the Indigenous peoples. The uniformed soldier in the centre is Corporal Francis Pegahmagabow who represents the valour and sacrifice of all Indigenous soldiers in Canada's military. The artist's rendition of a XII Manitoba Dragoons' armoured car brings us to World War II, while the rows of grave markers symbolize the sacrifice of all members of Canada's military. After both wars, Indigenous soldiers not only suffered the trauma of war, but also the overt discrimination by the Canadian government of the time.</p>
        <p>Below this painting is a shadow box honouring three individual Indigenous soldiers.</p>
        <p><strong>Francis Pegahmagabow</strong> was born March 1891 and died August 1952. He was an Ojibwe soldier, politician and activist in Canada. At the end of World War I, he was the most highly decorated Indigenous soldier in Canadian military history and was recognized as the most effective sniper of the war. He was awarded the Military Medal three times and seriously wounded. He was an expert marksman and scout and was credited with killing 378 Germans and capturing 300 more. Later in life, he served as chief and a councillor for the Wasauksing First Nation and as an activist and leader in several First Nations organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>Tommy Prince</strong> was born in 1915 in Petersfield, Manitoba. He was a member of the Ojibway Nation and learned hunting and tracking on the Brokenhead Reserve.</p>
        <p>At the start of World War II, after volunteering, Tommy Prince trained with an elite joint American Canadian unit and used his traditional Indigenous skills as they fought across France.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Tommy Prince also volunteered to serve in Korea during the Korean Conflict.</p>
        <p>In total, Tommy Prince was awarded 11 medals.</p>
        <p>Upon returning to Canada Sergeant Tommy Prince fought for equality and Indigenous rights.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Tommy Prince died in Winnipeg in 1977 and is buried in Brookside Cemetery, Winnipeg.</p>
        <p><strong>Charles Henry Byce</strong> was born in March of 1916 in Ontario.  He was born to a Cree mother and a non-Indigenous father. When World War II began, he followed his father's example from World War I and joined Canada's military. He went overseas with the 4th Canadian Armoured Division and fought across France and Belgium. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal for his actions in battle. Byce is Canada's most highly decorated Indigenous soldier of the Second World War. On returning to Canada after the War he was employed at a pulp and paper mill. He died in November of 1994 in Newmarket, Ontario.</p>
        <p>To your right is another shadow box honouring the memory of Private Herman Essie. Private Essie, born in Oak River, now known as Sioux Valley, Manitoba, was a survivor of the Canadian residential school system and a member of the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation. Private Essie was a member of the Border Horse Regiment, the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, the Regina Rifles and the XII Manitoba Dragoons. The hat badges of these four regiments are on display here. Included in the shadow box are Private Essie's medals which include the 1939 1945 War Medal, the Canadian Voluntary Service Medal with Overseas Bar, the Defence Medal, the France Germany Star and the 1939 – 1945 Star.  His identification tags, a medallion presented by the community of Oak River and a World War II General Service lapel pin are also on display.</p>
        <p>Below this is an eagle feather which holds great spiritual significance for Indigenous peoples. The eagle feather is used in ceremonies and rituals and is honoured as a sacred object by many tribes. The eagle feather symbolizes strength, wisdom and a strong connection to the Creator.</p>

        <p><strong>Francis Pegahmagabow</strong> was born on March 9, 1891, on the Parry Island Reserve in Ontario where he learned traditional skills such as hunting, fishing, and traditional medicine.</p>
        <p>At the outbreak of World War I, Pegahmagabow volunteered for service with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in August 1914. In early October 1914 he was deployed overseas with the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion of the 1st Canadian Division - the first contingent of Canadian troops sent to fight in Europe.</p>
        <p>In April of 1915, Pegahmagabow's company fought in the Second Battle of Ypres, where the Germans used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front. Following the battle, he was promoted to lance corporal. His battalion took part in the Battle of the Somme in 1916, during which he was wounded in the left leg. He received the Military Medal for carrying messages along the lines during these two battles.</p>
        <p>In November of 1917, Corporal Pegahmagabow earned a Bar to his Military Medal for his actions in the Second Battle of Passchendaele. During the fighting, Corporal Pegahmagabow played an important role when the battalion's reinforcements became lost. He helped lead the reinforcements to their allocated spot in the line.</p>
        <p>During the Battle of the Scarpe in August of 1918, Pegahmagabow was involved in fighting off a German attack at Orix Trench near Upton Wood. His company was almost out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded. Pegahmagabow braved heavy machine gun and rifle fire by going into no-man's land and brought back enough ammunition to defend the position. For these actions he received a second Bar to his Military Medal.</p>
        <p>World War I ended in November of 1918 and in 1919 Pegahmagabow returned to Canada. He was credited with killing 378 Germans and capturing 300 more.  He was first awarded the Military Medal in 1916 and earned two Bars for his excellence as a sniper and scout in the battles of Ypres in 1915, Passchendaele in 1917, Amiens in 1918 and Second Battle of Arras in 1918. On discharge, he was also awarded the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal.</p>
        <p>After the war, Francis Pegahmagabow became an advocate for Indigenous rights and self-determination. He died in August of 1952 at Parry Island, Ontario.</p>

        <p><strong>Sergeant Tommy Prince</strong> is one of Canada's most decorated Indigenous war veterans. Tommy Prince, a member of the Ojibway Nation, was born in 1915 in Petersfield, Manitoba. He became a master marksman and tracker while hunting and trapping with his father on the Brokenhead Reserve.</p>
        <p>Prince was finally accepted into the Canadian military in 1940 after being rejected due to discrimination. He was one of a select group of Canadians chosen to train with an elite joint American-Canadian commando unit to form a specialized assault team; the 1st Special Service Force, known as the “Devil's Brigade”.</p>
        <p>In Italy and France with the 1st Special Service Force, Prince used his tracking and marksman skills in several covert actions that resulted in military success. Prince was known to put on his moccasins from his rucksack and go scouting alone in the dark of night.</p>
        <p>The 1st Special Service Force was deployed to Italy in 1943. During the attack on Monte Majo, Sergeant Tommy Prince single-handedly eliminated the German gun emplacements on the lower and middle slopes, allowing the summit of Monte Majo to be taken without a single shot being fired.</p>
        <p>On another occasion, during the 1944 Anzio campaign, near Littoria, Italy, Sergeant Tommy Prince was sent forward to report the location of German assembly areas and artillery positions. Acting alone, Prince laid communication wire from an abandoned farmhouse where he was hiding back to the Special Service Force position. During an artillery barrage the wire was cut and Prince, dressed as a farmer weeding his garden was later able to repair the line while pretending to tie his shoelaces. Prince carried on this deception by shaking his fist at both the Germans and the Allies. He continued his reports and four German batteries were taken out of action. Prince spent three days alone behind enemy lines. Sergeant Tommy Prince was awarded the Military Medal for his heroic actions during this campaign.</p>
        <p>There are numerous recorded accounts of Sergeant Tommy Prince's bravery and selflessness during other military actions.</p>
        <p>When the fighting in France ended, Prince was awarded the Military Medal and the American Silver Star with Ribbon by King George VI at Buckingham Palace.</p>
        <p>Tommy Prince also served in Korea but again faced overt discrimination.</p>
        <p>Once back in Canada, Indigenous military members, including Sergeant Tommy Prince, were refused the same benefits as other Canadian veterans.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Tommy Prince is also remembered as an Indigenous advocate who fought for equality and Indigenous rights. Sergeant Tommy Prince died in Winnipeg in 1977 and is buried in Brookside Cemetery, Winnipeg.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Tommy Prince was awarded a total of 11 medals. His decorations and medals are: The Military Medal, the American Silver Star with Ribbon, the 1939-1945 Star, the Italy Star, the France-Germany Star, the Defence Medal, the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with Clasp and the War Medal. Sergeant Tommy Prince was awarded the Canada-Korea Medal and the United Nations Service Medal (Korea) posthumously. He also became entitled to the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal for Korea created in 1991.</p>

        <p><strong>Charles Henry Byce</strong> was born in Ontario in 1916. He was educated at the Saint John's Residential School in Chapleau, Ontario.</p>
        <p>In 1940, Charles Byce joined the Lake Superior Regiment which was later attached to the 4th Armoured Brigade in the 4th Canadian Armoured Division. The unit left for Britain in 1942 and more training. The unit landed on the beaches of Normandy in July 1944 and advanced across France and Belgium towards Germany.</p>
        <p>Acting Corporal Byce was awarded the Military Medal for his actions while deployed in the Netherlands in January, 1945. He was charged with protecting a group of soldiers who were to go behind enemy lines to capture prisoners for interrogation. When the patrol came under fire, Byce moved forward alone and ended the attack with grenades, ensuring the success of the mission.</p>
        <p>Acting Sergeant Byce was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions in March 1945 south of the Hochwald Forest. As the few remaining men from his Company were attempting to retreat, Byce remained behind, shooting at the German tanks to give the men time to reach safer ground.</p>
        <p>In July, 1945, Acting Sergeant Charles Byce was presented with both the Military Medal and The Distinguished Conduct Medal by King George VI at Buckingham Palace in London, England. He is one of only nine Canadian soldiers to be awarded both these medals.</p>
        <p>At the end of the war, Byce returned to Canada and settled in Espanola, Ontario where he worked at a pulp and paper mill.</p>
        <p>Charles Byce died in 1994 in Newmarket, Ontario.</p>
