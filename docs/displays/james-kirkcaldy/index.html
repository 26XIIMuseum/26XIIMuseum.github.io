        <p>This display commemorates <strong>Brigadier General James Kirkcaldy</strong> who was a member of the Manitoba Dragoons and the 99th Manitoba Rangers. Most of his military career was with the 8th Winnipeg Rifles and the 78th Battalion of the Winnipeg Grenadiers in France during World War I.  On display is a photograph of Brigadier General James Kirkcaldy, his identification tags and the World War I decorations and medals which he was awarded. The Imperial German Army bugle to the right was captured along with a frightened young signaller after Kirkcaldy voiced annoyance about the noise of the bugle.</p>
