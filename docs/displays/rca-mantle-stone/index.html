        <p>This mantle stone, bearing the insignia of the Royal Canadian Artillery, was formerly situated above the fireplace in the Officer's Mess in the Canadian Artillery Training Centre Number 4 (A4) in Brandon during World War II.</p>
        <p>Thousands of young Canadian volunteers were trained at this Centre before heading to England for more training and then to Europe and the front lines.</p>
        <p>Rumor has it that after this training Centre was demolished, the stone disappeared. Many years later, a Brandon resident was remodelling his yard and upon turning over what was believed to be a cement step was surprised to find the Artillery insignia. The stone was then donated to the Museum.</p>
