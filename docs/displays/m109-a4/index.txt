The M109 A4 155 mm self-propelled Howitzer

The M109 155 mm self-propelled Howitzer was first used by regular army field batteries in 1968 during the Cold War in Europe with Canada’s NATO Brigade Group.
The 155 mm cannon could fire in a 360-degree circle. The secondary armament was a 50-calibre M2 heavy barrel machine gun. The M109 had a short barrel initially but modifications to improve protection and range resulted in the longer barrel version seen here called the M109 A4.
The M109 A4 required ten gunners to operate. It had a range of 18,000 meters or 22,000 meters with special ammunition. The ammunition for the M109 was carried on a Heavy Logistics Vehicle Wheeled truck and each projectile weighed 98 pounds.
The M109 was in Canadian service for a record 37 years – from 1968 to 2005.
This M109 A4 is dedicated to the memory of LCol Ross Thompson, former Commanding Officer of 26th Field Regiment Royal Canadian Artillery and to all past, present and future members of the 26th Field Regiment Royal Canadian Artillery.
