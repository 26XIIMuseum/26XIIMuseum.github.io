This mantle stone, bearing the insignia of the Royal Canadian Artillery, was formerly situated above the fireplace in the Officer's Mess in the Canadian Artillery Training Centre Number 4 (A4) in Brandon during World War II.

Thousands of young Canadian volunteers were trained at this Centre before heading to England for more training and then to Europe and the front lines.

Rumor has it that after this training Centre was demolished, the stone disappeared. Many years later, a Brandon resident was remodelling his yard and upon turning over what was believed to be a cement step was surprised to find the Artillery insignia. The stone was then donated to the Museum.
